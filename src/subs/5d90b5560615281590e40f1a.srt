00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,500
Welcome to section 6 in the section.
We're going to take a quick break

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,900
from exploring new react features to
talk about a little bit of tooling

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,200
and the tool we're going to cover in
this section is webpack webpack is

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,800
an asset bundle or it's going to
combine all of the assets that make

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:23,350
up our application with all of the
assets needed from third-party

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,650
libraries.
And this is going to allow us to do

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,700
a couple of exciting thinks it's
going to allow us to take advantage

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,750
of third-party libraries in our
projects to remember earlier.

9
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,300
I talked about that vast ecosystem
of libraries that you can use the

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,300
solve common problems like date
Pickers or drag-and-drop.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We're now actually going to be able
to start to take advantage of that.

12
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,050
The second great thing we're going
to be able to do with webpack is

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,100
we're going to be able to take our
own application code and break it up

14
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,650
across multiple files.
So we want to be in a situation

15
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,700
where each component lives in its
own file Soar application is easier

16
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,100
to man.
Now the sections going to start off

17
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:09,150
with a basic introduction of webpack
along the way will be configuring it

18
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,100
and exploring all of the features it
provides.

19
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,500
All right, let's Jump Right In.
